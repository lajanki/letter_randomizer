Dear Mr. <span class="receiver"></span>,

Please accept this letter as notice of my retirement from the position of chemical analyst at Pointwise Convergence.

I have enjoyed my time with the business immensely and have had great satisfaction in taking on the challenges given to me. I have learnt many things, made many friends, and have many memories that will stay with me forever.

As per the terms of my employment contract, I will continue to work for the company for the next 4 weeks, completing my employment on February 14th. If there are any areas in particular you would like me to focus on during my notice period, please let me know.

I am thankful for the opportunities you have given me during my time here. Whilst thoroughly looking forward to my retirement, I will miss working with you a great deal and I hope we can stay in touch.

I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

Yours sincerely,
