Dear Representative,

Tax reform is once again high on the nation's agenda. May I briefly voice my strong support for far-reaching, comprehensive reform? Specifically, I support simplification of the tax code by


 1. eliminating inequitable loopholes,
 2. establishing a flat-rate income tax, and
 3. ending excessive withholding practices.


I hardly need to cite the advantages of reform. To the vast majority of our citizens, these are so obvious that not a single advocate (on either the right or the left) can be found for preserving the status quo. Never has the will of the nation's electorate been so unanimous on an issue of such importance. Isn't it time to seize the moment?

A deciding factor for me during your last campaign was your commitment to tax reform. Please do not slacken in your reform efforts. Continue to vigorously pursue the reform you promised. I look forward to a future in which the calculating and paying of taxes is efficient, straightforward, and, above all, fair.

Regards,
