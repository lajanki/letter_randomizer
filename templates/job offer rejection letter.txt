Dear Ms. <span class="receiver"></span>:

Thank you for offering me the position of Financial Analyst with Gleeman Sachs. I appreciate your willingness to discuss the details of the position with me and give me time to consider your offer. It was a difficult decision to make; however, I have accepted a position with another company.

You have a great organization and many aspects of the position are very appealing. I appreciate your consideration throughout the interview process and also enjoyed learning more about Gleeman Sachs.

Thanks again for taking the time to consider my candidacy. It was a pleasure meeting you and your staff.

Sincerely,
