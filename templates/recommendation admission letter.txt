Dear Ms. <span class="receiver"></span>,

I am writing this recommendation letter for Ms. Miranda Hathaway. She has been a hard working student in the Arts section at Quebec High School for four years. Miranda has been a meritorious student with exceptional grades throughout these four years.
 
Among her many other activities Miranda possess superior inter-personal skills and leadership quality. She excelled in a number of fund-raising projects at the school including a Charity dance competition that raised over $6000 for the cancer patients. She is equally active in Sports and dramatics.
 
She is a fond student of her teachers and is popular amongst peers and her juniors, who she helped out sail in their first year of high school. Miranda has a keen interest in world affairs and has traveled extensively across the world. She intends to pursue an Honors degree in Political Science.

I believe that Miranda Hathaway has tremendous potential as a student in your esteemed university and I feel quite confident that she would be an asset to both student life and academics at Canada University.

Sincerely,
