Dear Editor:

As a practicing architect and a concerned community resident, I urge the Department of
Public Works to install a sidewalk along Busy Road between the public high school and
the shopping center.

Currently, walking along Busy Road is a dangerous enterprise, but many people risk it
because they have no other choice. Ten pedestrians were injured last year and five were
killed, including three children.

Installing sidewalks would allow people to walk more safely. Students could walk from
the high school to their jobs after school at the shopping center. People in the
neighborhood could walk to the shops rather than driving a few blocks. We’d feel more
like the neighborhood many of us grew up in, meeting each other face to face on the
sidewalk instead of driving past insulated in our cars.

I urge all concerned citizens to come to the town council meeting on Thursday at 7:30
p.m. in the town hall to show their support for a sidewalk along Busy Road. Mayor
Smith, the head of the Department of Public Works, and the entire planning commission
are expected to attend. Let’s make our voices heard!

Sincerely,
