I'm a Laid back guy who enjoys spending time with friends and meeting new people. I have three sisters and my family means the world to me. One of my favorite hobbies is surfing during the high tides.

A perfect night for me is getting my family together and cooking a nice dinner for everyone. I try to always remain positive and be in a good mood. I like to go out and have a good meal over stimulating conversation. In terms of going on dates, I am not very hard to please. As long as I am spending quality time with my significant other, I am a happy guy. I believe in karma and that you should always treat others how you would like to be treated. 

I am looking for a women that is fun loving and spontaneous. Some other characteristics I am looking for include: independence, sense of humor, career driven and trustworthy. 

Relationships require effort by each partner. Good communication is vital for me and the willingness to make certain compromises to better the relationship. I'm excited to meet some new people and see what this site is all about!
