Dear Ms. Olson,

While visiting city hall, I saw the flyer posted by the Anchorage Public Library. I feel it is very important to support institutions of culture and learning, and I am interested in the Circulation Volunteer position. If there is no current need for volunteers in this position, I would be willing to donate my time in another needed capacity.

I take great pride in our library and think it is the duty of every citizen to support it. I already have experience with library shelving and the Dewey Decimal System from my years volunteering at the Abbott Loop Elementary School Library when my children attended there. Having been a Blood Drive Volunteer with the American Red Cross since 1998, I am also organized and good at working with the general public.

Please give me a call and let me know what I can do to help. I can be reached by phone at (907) 555-8888 or by email at kjonhson@email.com. I am excited to do my share in helping such a crucial part of our community.

Thank you for your time and all you do for our library. I look forward to talking to you.

Best,
Karen Johnson
