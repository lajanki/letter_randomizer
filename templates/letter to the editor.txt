Dear Editor:

While circuses and traveling shows featuring wild animal acts may seem innocent enough, it has become apparent over the past decade that wild animal acts are inherently cruel and unsafe.

Most circuses and traveling shows that use wild animals keep them for months on end in cramped transport cages, sometimes hardly larger than they are, with only brief periods outside to perform. The animals have no opportunity to move or behave in a natural way. That's why veterinarians, animal behaviourists, biologists and animal welfare organizations around the world have condemned wild animal acts.

Circuses and traveling shows with wild animals also pose a risk to human safety. Numerous circus employees have been seriously injured or killed by performing animals and circus audience members have been injured when handlers have lost control of their animals. Many performing animals are large, potentially dangerous species that even zoos don't handle. But when they perform in circuses and traveling shows, they often do so without adequate protection for staff and audience members.

We now know that performing animals suffer in circuses and traveling shows and that wild animal acts pose a danger to human safety. Hundreds of jurisdictions around the world, including entire countries, have recognized this and prohibited wild animals acts.

Our community should not condone cruelty to animals by allowing performing animal acts to visit, nor should we wait for someone to be injured or killed before we decide to act in the interest of human safety. Mobile should consider a prohibition on wild animal acts as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
