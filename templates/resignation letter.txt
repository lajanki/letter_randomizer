Dear Mr. <span class="receiver"></span>,

Please accept this letter as notice of my resignation from the position of senior economy manager at Abbay Ltd.

Although my employment contract states a required notice period of 4 weeks, I would like to extend this to 6 weeks, completing my employment on the end of January. I hope to use this extra time to complete the projects I am currently working on and arrange a comprehensive handover for my replacement.

I have enjoyed being a part of the team and am thankful for the opportunities you have given me during my time here.

I hope that I can rely on you for a positive reference in future.

Yours sincerely,
