Dear Park Department,

I received your letter of March 12, 2013, alleging that Colonel Corporation has dumped hazardous waste into the Shangus River. I am sure that by bringing a few facts to your attention we can resolve this matter quickly.

Colonel does not manufacture or handle any hazardous waste. We process and can food. Moreover, we dispose of any liquids or materials used in processing and canning through a waste management system built in compliance with Federal and State waste disposal regulations. The system functions very well, is economical, and results in a solution many local farmers use as organic fertilizer. Colonel has no need, economic or otherwise, to dump hazardous waste.

I invite you to tour our plant and review our records before you pursue your allegations. I am sure you will find that they are without basis in fact.

Regards,
