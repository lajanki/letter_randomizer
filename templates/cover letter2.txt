Dear Mrs. <span class="receiver"></span>

I saw your ad for an experienced sewing machine operator in the Anahaim Times and would like to be considered for this position.

I have enjoyed sewing for family and friends for many years. Three years ago, I entered the workforce and joined the sewing team at Durable Luggage Company. My experience on the Juki Industrial machine includes sewing all sizes of luggage together, vinyl as well as canvas.

I have also gained experience sewing vinyl and leather upholstery. Last year, my employer received an order from a furniture manufacturing company that provided us with a lot of upholstery work for several months. Unfortunately, the company is now sending a lot of their work to India because of increasing labor costs here and I need to look for a new job.

My employer has also used some of my ideas and designs. For example, I recommended that the sewing process at Durable Luggage Company be slightly modified. By sewing the inside flaps first and changing the order of how the bag's components are attached to each other, the company was able to streamline the luggage manufacturing process. Because of this change, the company's productivity rate increased by 12 percent and I earned the "Outstanding Employee Award," which included a bonus check for $500.

I believe that I am well-qualified to be a sewing machine operator at Doe Luggage Company. Please look over my enclosed resume for more details. My phone number is 555-5555. I will call your office in a few days to see if I can set up an interview with you at that time.

Sincerely,
