Dear Mr. Rades:

It is with great enthusiasm that I accept the Program Coordinator position with the Boys and Girls Club of Green Bay. I thoroughly reviewed the details of the position in the letter of employment I received. I look forward to beginning the position and the opportunity to work with young adults through the After-School Program.

As we discussed, my starting salary will be $23,000 with the full range of benefits granted to professionals. I understand that the training program begins on July 8th. As requested, I will complete the advance employment and benefits forms as I receive them and promptly return them to you at the address listed above.

I will await further correspondence from your office and the employment contract. In the meantime, if you need any additional information, please feel free to contact me any time. I look forward to beginning the program and meeting my fellow colleagues.

Sincerely,
Janet C. Smith
