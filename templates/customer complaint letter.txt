To the manager of Taco Tacontento:

I am writing to bring to your attention a serious issue I had in your establishment last week. I ordered a vegetarian bean burrito, and halfway through my meal, I bit into what turned out to be a chicken bone.

I am a vegetarian, and the presence of bone in my burrito was jarring. I showed the bone to the staff, who offered to make me a new burrito with the same beans the bone presumably came from. I did not want to risk eating any meat or finding another bone, so I asked for a taco salad instead.

I am a regular customer at your restaurant, and I have never had any problems with your food in the past. While I am relatively certain this was a fluke, I am still concerned about how the bone got into the beans. I would like to know how this might have happened.

I am also concerned with the lack of understanding I received from the staff member who helped me. I don't know if she was working alone or merely misunderstood my request, but she refused to let me speak to her supervisor while I was in the restaurant. I felt she acted very unprofessionally.

I hope to hear back from you about this incident. I can be reached by phone at (555) 867-5309 at any time or by email at mhoss@mailclient.com.

Sincerely,
