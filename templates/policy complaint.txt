Dear Transit Division,

I would like to register a complaint regarding the ridiculous traffic enforcement practices adopted the last three Thursday evenings at the intersection of Main and Elm streets in Jacksonville.

On Thursdays Mustard Tavern holds an informal "Cruise In" and sells tacos at half price with the profits donated to a variety of charities. The participants, owners and admirers of customized cars and motorcycles, enjoy the weekly event because of the opportunity to show off and admire the vehicles in a friendly atmosphere. On the last three Thursdays, however, Jacksonville's finest have blocked Elm Street at Main to all traffic from the south. This is done, the officers say, to prevent backups at this intersection. The roadblock necessitates a long detour around the north side of Jacksonville, and the backup created by the roadblock stretched much further than it ever did before this enforcement began.

The resentment and tension among the Cruise In's participants is an unhealthy byproduct of this silly policy. The weekly event has existed for over four years with a minimum of problems; there have been more confrontations between motorists and police as a result of this enforcement than in the last four years combined. I would very much like to see an official review of this enforcement practice. Look specifically at the efficiency of the roadblock. If the police wish to shut down Mustard's Cruise In, let them attempt to do so through viable, straightforward means.

Regards,
