Hey there. I can't guarantee you that we already have a lot in common, but if you read on and find out we do, you should message me!

I want someone who will be upfront, honest, and I will do the same.

It would be nice to have someone who would enjoy travelling around Europe, and of course trying out local eateries. There's nothing like a good dinner and then going for a walk with a great companion at sunset! But it's give and take too, and I won't complain when you take me along shopping at the mall or while I sit in the waiting room when you get your nails done. I understand that being together is the most important part of a relationship no matter what we are doing (besides communication, of course).

I'd like to think I'm a simple guy. I have a great career, but my biggest weakness is probably wanting to keep in touch with all my firnds.

I'm now looking for a relationship, but I'm not looking to jump into anything without getting to know someone first. I've never been married, so I'm pretty sure it won't kill me to take things slow and make sure we are compatible. If you are divorced, I'm totally OK with that. You had to leave him in order to find me right?

Anyways I think I wrote enough for now. Anything else feel free to ask or save for the first date. Don't be bashful!
