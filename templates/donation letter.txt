A request for Your Attention

Dear Sir/Madam:
Adventure Works is a social service agency in this county serving the needs of families at risk. We recently purchased a building but it needs major repairs and renovations to comply with city building codes. The counseling office also needs office furniture and equipment, especially a photocopier.

Your company can help us by providing funds in the form of a grant or by donating goods and services. A copy of our tax-exempt certificate is attached.
Thank you in advance for your support.

Sincerely,

Adventure Works
