Dear Ms. <span class="receiver"></span>,

Whilst browsing the job adverts on your website, I came across your vacancy for a Cleaner and was immediately attracted to it. At the moment I am working in a very similar role to the one you are advertising, and I feel that I have all of the skills that you are looking for in a candidate.

As you can see from my attached CV I have been working for the last 2 years for Adams Cleaning Services where I have gained experience of sweeping, mopping, scrubbing, and vacuuming floor areas. In addition to this I have learnt how to properly clean fixtures such as desks, sinks, urinals, and windows, as well as how to empty, clean and sanitize waste baskets. I always use safety equipment appropriately and have the mental ability to add, subtract, multiply, and divide in all units of measure.

As a physical fit individual I will have no problem walking, stooping, kneeling, crouching, or crawling to get a job done. I am able to able to lift and carry heavy loads up and down stairs and am comfortable having a role that is physically demanding.

On a personal level I have no problem working independently in the absence of supervision, and always have a good attitude toward customers, fellow team members and management. I am a bright, energetic person who is looking to join a company like yours that fully supports its employees and assists them in their training and career development needs.

I have enclosed my CV with this letter and that will give you more detailed information about my education and competencies. I thank you for your time and expectantly wait to hear a positive response from you.

Yours sincerely,
