Dear Mrs Whinnig,  

I am responding to your advertisement for nannies and au pairs that appeared in my local newspaper last Wednesday. I have always wanted to visit a foreign country and would love to have the experience of living in the United States for a while. I am willing to commit to an employment period of one year, as either a nanny or an au pair.

I have done a great deal of baby-sitting, tending both my two younger brothers and the children of several neighbors. I can cook reasonably well and am hard-working and responsible. I have also certified in CPR and have done first aid training with the Red Cross. I have a driver's license, though not, of course, in the US.

I have enclosed a copy of my resume, as was requested in your ad, and look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
