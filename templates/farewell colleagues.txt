Farewell!

All right, maybe we shouldn’t be quite so formal. But it does feel a little bit dramatic, doesn’t it, getting this letter from all of us? Sort of like you’re standing on the deck of a ship, waving to a crowd that’s screaming, bon voyage! over the sound of a loud horn.

Or maybe you just think it looks like a letter signed by all of us. The point is, we’re writing because we’ll miss you and we want to make sure you never forget it. Working with you for the past 14 years has been great, and it’s a shame that all good things must come to an end. We’ll have to go on and do investor scouting without you, even though we all know that your work on client management is the reason we still have jobs.

We know you’re going to be amazing at building your own company, so we’ll try not to be too sad that it means you’re leaving us behind.

Please keep in touch!


Good luck,

Your old pals
