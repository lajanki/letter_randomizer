## Final demand for Payment ##

Dear Sir/Madam;  
Despite repeated requests for payment, your account's past-due balance remains unsettled. (Furthermore, we've received no communication from your office by way of explanation as to why the account has extended to 9 days past due.)

We request resolution of this issue and payment within 4 business days.

If we have not received your cooperation and remittance in full by that time, we will have no other choice but to pursue further actions to collect this long overdue balance.

Sincerely,  
<span class="signature"></span>  
Credit Manager MadeUp Corp.
