Can you believe it's been nearly twenty years since the pomp and circumstance of our graduation? Come join the class this summer; see how twenty years have changed everyone except you!

The festivities will get under way on Friday, July 20, with dinner and a reception/dance beginning at 7:00 p.m. in the Zum Hotel Grand Ballroom. For Saturday we will book passage on the Frisco Mountain Breakfast Train. A scenic train ride will take us to San Fernando reservoir for water-skiing, volleyball, and an afternoon barbecue. The train will return us to the depot at 6:00 p.m.

Please reserve your spot as early as possible by filling in the enclosed registration and questionnaire, and returning them with your $20 deposit to Barton Calibre, reunion secretary.

We will send a confirmation packet upon receipt of your deposit. This will include an up-to-the-minute agenda of planned activities, information on lodging in the area, and a list of classmates we've been unable to locate. Please join the class of 1997--"Making Our Mark, 20 Years Later!"
