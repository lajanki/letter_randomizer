This letter is prompted by the noblest of impulses, so don't misunderstand the message it is going to convey.

When I met you, as if by a God-sent blessing, I thought that I saw a light of soft understanding. What had come over me? I never felt like this before. Yes, before I met you, I lived a peaceful life. I could come and go and feel no trouble. But now, I am disturbed, both body and soul.

Can it be my imagination, or is it that love has struck too deeply, and I must pay for what is asked of me? I have tried to restrain myself. I have tried to stifle my desires, knowing that I am not worthy. But love's orders are imperative. Who am I to battle the call of fate? I know that when I saw you, Cupid had marked me for his victim. Yes, it is love that has taken root in my heart.

Let me console myself that I have loved you in name only, a way that lingers only in imagination, in a mere dream, in fantasy, the creation of my lonely heart. Here I am still longing for your attention. I love you!
