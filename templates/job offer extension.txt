Dear Ms Hamborger,

On behalf of Shuttle Yard Industries I am pleased to extend this offer of employment at our New Jersey office. Shuttle Yard is offering you the position of administrative assistant beginning April 1, 2002. As we discussed in our call earlier today, you will be paid an hourly salary of $10. Enclosed is a copy of the standard employee agreement. As previously mentioned, you will be asked to sign the agreement as a condition of employment.

Shuttle Yard is mandated to comply with the 1986 Immigration and Control Act. Therefore, this offer is contingent upon your supplying original documents proving U.S. citizenship or the authority to work in the United States. Please examine the "Employer Review and Verification" section of the enclosed Form I-9 for the types of documents that we will need to review at your orientation.
