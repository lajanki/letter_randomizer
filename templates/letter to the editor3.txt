Dear Editor:

November 18, 2016, will mark the observance of Education Support Professionals Day, a time for saluting our public school education support professionals (ESPs) and the contributions they make to education. The interaction between children, parents, and ESPs is vital to the continued success of public education. Their work is something to celebrate.

Today's ESPs do more than provide nutritious meals and transport our children to and from school; they also serve as positive role models.

Parents and community members, visit your child's school and learn for yourself how ESPs serve as essential and equal education partners. A simple 'thank you' or card for these hard working professionals would be welcomed and greatly appreciated.

Thank you for taking time to read this letter. I'm proud to make a difference in the lives of your children by being an essential partner in their education. Let's make time together to celebrate all of our work on their behalf.

Sincerely,
