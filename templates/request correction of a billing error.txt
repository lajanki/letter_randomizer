I wish to register a complaint regarding the $5.00 charge on my phone bill from Doe Long Distance Companies. Since Doe is not my long distance carrier and to my knowledge has never provided me with any services whatsoever, I have requested that my bank stop the automatic payment on my phone bill. I am enclosing a check for the remaining $57.49 that I owe, and I request that you remove the Doe charge from my account.

Since this is not the first time I have received a charge from Doe, please investigate this error and inform me of the steps you are taking to avoid this problem in the future.

Sincerely,
