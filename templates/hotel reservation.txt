Dear Hotel Rexford,  

I would like to reserve a double room for the nights of June 20, 21, and 22. My husband is confined to a wheelchair, so we need to have a shower stall and a room which are wheelchair accessible. Please note that we will not be arriving until about 10:00 p.m. on the night of June 20.

I am enclosing a check for $50.00 as a deposit. Please send written confirmation of this reservation to me at the above address. If you have any questions, my phone number is 555-5555.

Thank you very much. We are looking forward to our stay at the Gentleman's Plaza.

Thank you,
