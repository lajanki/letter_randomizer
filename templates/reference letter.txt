Employment Review Committee:

I am pleased to recommend Jane Middletoe as a candidate for the position of office manager. Ms. Middletoe has been a capable manager in our Nebraska office since 2007.

During her tenure there, Jane almost single-handedly doubled the revenue of her division. In 2009, she implemented a restructuring of the sales force, markedly increasing sales and reducing travel expenses. Her interpersonal skills and emphasis on efficiency has made Nebraska our most productive branch. I regret that she has decided to leave us.

Ms. Doe has expressed her desire to move on to a position that affords her greater flexibility and growth potential. I enthusiastically recommend her for this position. If you have any questions I can answer about Ms. Middletoe's exceptional record with our company, please do not hesitate to contact me.
