Dear Sir,

Request Letter for the Admission of My Daughter

I, Maria Patson, mother of Ms. Claire Patson would like to request you for her admission in your school in grade 7. She has been a bright student all this while and attached are the copies of her grade sheets for your convenience. We have recently moved to California due to which we had to change her school and yours being one of the best in California, I had no second thoughts about any other school.

Also attached is the duly filled admission form along with the copies of her various certificates that she has won in her extra curriculum activities. She was also awarded the Best Academic performer for two consecutive years in her previous school.

I am quite confident that my daughter wonâ€™t let you down and bring laurels to your school. I have attached two recommendation letters, one from the Principal of her previous school and other from her Science Teacher.

I hope that you will give due consideration to my request letter.


Yours Truly,
