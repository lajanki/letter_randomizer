Dear <span class="receiver first"></span>,

I come to you seeking advice on a personal matter because you have known me since sixth grade and I admire your life experiences and knowledge of academia. I know also that you will honor my request for confidentiality.

What would you do if you had to decide between applying for government financial aid to complete a graduate degree or working full time for six months to earn enough money and have less debt?

I have recently borrowed to purchase an automobile and insurance liability coverage. The monthly payments are low and manageable with my part-time job, but I need money now to cover tuition costs. While I am reluctant to borrow more money, I worry that I may choose not to return to school if I take six months off.

Please let me know your thoughts on this subject. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for letting me express my concerns to you.

With Best Reagrds,
