Dear Mrs. <span class="receiver"></span>,

I am writing to ask for your support for a truly special event I will be participating in on December 1, 2012. I am braving the cold to join TriCity Family Services at their Snowflake Shuffle!

The Snowflake Shuffle is a 5K Run and Walk for the whole family that raises money and awareness for TriCity Family Services. TriCity Family Services provides quality, accessible counseling to all residents of central Kane County, as well as an array of support groups, workshops and programs that promote sound mental health and effective family functioning.

TriCity Family Services is committed to making their programs and services affordable to everyone; particularly those uninsured or underinsured individuals and families for whom outpatient mental health services in the private sector are simply out of reach financially. At TriCity Family Services, no one is ever denied services based on an inability to pay.

Through my participation in the Snowflake Shuffle, I am hoping to raise $8 000 in donations. I need your help!

Please join me in making a donation to TriCity Family Services to support this me, and this great cause. TriCity is a certified organization so your donation is tax-deductible to the full extent allowed by law.

With your help, I know we can make a difference for the thousands of children, families and struggling adults in our community who will have their lives changed by TriCity Family Services this year. I know we all have been through times where compassionate counseling and a supportive hand up would have helped a lot.

Thanks for your generosity. I hope I can count on you.

Sincerely,
