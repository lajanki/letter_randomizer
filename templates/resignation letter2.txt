Dear Jill,  

I am writing to you today to officially tender my resignation from Merck effective Friday, November 16.

I never thought I would ever leave such a great company as Merck, but when the opportunity arose to own and operate my own vineyard in Napa, which as you know has always been a lifelong dream for me, I simply had to take advantage of it.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Merck, about all the people I’ve encountered in my years of service with the company, and especially about you and all the others on the sales team. Your leadership has taken us all to new levels, and I have appreciated all your personal and professional advice over the years. It’s my hope that we will stay in touch as I begin this new chapter in my life.

If you have any questions, please ask. Thanks again for everything.

Sincerely,
