Dear Sir,

Please let me take this opportunity to introduce myself as the newly appointed sales agent for GK Trading Company. As I joined the company recently I went through our records to find that you are one of our most valuable customers.

As an initiative to a growing business relationship that will benefit both of us, I will be pleased to visit you in your office at your convenience in order to understand about your company to enable me to provide you with a better service. I could also introduce our new products to you.

I wish to call in your office, want to make the appointment, as am looking forward to meeting you personally.

Thanking You,

Yours sincerely,
