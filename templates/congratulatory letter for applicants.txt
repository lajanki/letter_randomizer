Dear <span class="receiver first"></span>,

Congratulations! I am pleased to inform you that you have been selected for membership in the 57th class of Mortar Board at Blank University.

By now, you should have been notified of your acceptance by your *tapping* by outgoing members.  We are very excited to welcome you to the Cap and Gown chapter of Mortar Board, the premier national honor society recognizing college seniors for superior achievement in scholarship, leadership and service. Only a select few students on each campus are invited to join this esteemed society - an honor naming you among the most amazing college scholar-leaders in the U.S.

We hope that you will note the following upcoming chapter activities, which are also outlined in your tapping packet:

**Orientation**: Please join us at 10 a.m. on Saturday, March 12 for orientation.  At this time you will learn more specifics about what our chapter does.  Don't forget to bring a $75 check for your membership fee to orientation!

**Initiation**: Your initiation ceremony will be held at 3 p.m. on Saturday, April 2 in University Hall. More information about this event is available at orientation, as well as in your tapping packet.

Please review the information in your tapping packet prior to orientation.  In your packet, you should see your Member Guide, orientation flier, initiation invitation, history of the Blank University chapter of Mortar Board, and a list of chapter activities from now through the end of the school year.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact the current president, advisor or membership chairperson using the contact information listed in your packet.

Our Society provides its members with opportunities for continued leadership development, promotes service to colleges and universities and encourages lifelong contributions to the global community. Additionally, Mortar Board offers numerous benefits to members, including career networking, fellowships and awards. Membership in Mortar Board is synonymous with dedication and success. Many Mortar Board members have gone on to have amazingly successful careers, win prestigious awards, and contribute unmatched service to their communities. We welcome you into this distinguished group, and look forward to the impact you will make on campus this academic year!
