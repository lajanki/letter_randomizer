Dear Ms. <span class="receiver"></span>,

As you know, Heart's Press's publication of Camomber City's art magazine has been funded by a renewable annual grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Regrettably, recent cutbacks in federally sponsored city arts programs have not left us unscathed. Our grant having been discontinued, we have no alternative but to cease publication of City Artist. You have my assurance that the board has searched long and hard for some other viable funding, but every avenue of recourse has closed before us. Accordingly, June's issue will be our last.

This change means the termination of employment for the entire magazine staff of writers, editors, and correspondents, including both full- and part-time employees. We ask you all to help see production of June's issue through to press according to the existing schedule, with May 15 as your last work day. We will meet briefly as a group Monday morning, May 1, to discuss insurance and unemployment issues.

Anyone who has been involved with this project, including myself, knows that City Artist has meant far more too many of you than a mere job: it's been a labor of love. I wish I could express how unhappy I am to find myself bearing such ill tidings. Please let me know how I can assist you as you seek new employment.

Sincerely,  
<span class="signature"></span>  
Editor-in-Chief  
Heart's Press's
